Introduction
============

In this Red Pitaya FPGA project, we will learn about communication between the Linux processing system and the programmable logic. We will demonstrate the basic functionality with a simple FPGA project – Stopwatch.

The FPGA algorithm will be based on a 32-bit binary counter with Clock Enable (CE) and Synchronous Clear (SCLR) inputs, which we will control from the Linux side. The counter’s output value will be read with a Linux program and partially displayed with the on-board LEDs. In order to do this, we will use the standard AXI communication protocol that connects different parts of the Zynq device, such as the processing system, programmable logic, DDR memory, external peripherals, and more.

This guide assumes that you are familiar with the concepts introduced in the previous examples.


==============
Verilog Module
==============

- Open one of the previous Vivado projects to get a basic block diagram. 
- Next, insert the *binary counter* IP core, if it is not already present, and add the *CE* and *SCLR ports*. This can be done by *double-clicking* on the *binary counter IP core* in our block design and selecting *CE* and *SCLR* under the *Control tab*. - Then add an *xlslice* IP block with the following dimensions: *Din Width: 32, Din From: 31, Din Down To: 24*.
- Connect the binary counter's CLK pin to PS's *FCLK_CLK0*, the binary counter's output to the *xlslice*'s input, and the *xlslice*'s output to the *led_o* external port. This last part will display 8 MSBs of the 32-bit counter on Red Pitaya’s LED bar.
- If you started from Project 1, change the LEFT property of the *led_o* port from 0 to 7.

- We are ready to insert the AXI General Purpose IO IP core (*AXI GPIO*) into our block design.
- When the core is added, double-click on the block, check *Enable Dual Channel* and set *All Inputs* for the GPIO 2.
- To connect the *AXI GPIO* to the processing system, click on *Run Connection Automation* on top of the block design. Select *S_AXI* and click OK. This will automatically create AXI Interconnect and Processor System Reset blocks.
- Next, add two *xlslice* IP cores with 32-bit Din. *xls_CE* should have *Din From* and *Din Down* both set to 0 and *xls_SCLR* should have them both set to 1.

- Connect all the blocks as shown in the figure below.

    Block Design

Next, we need to set the *AXI GPIO* core’s memory address and range. We will use this address later to access the IP core from the Linux side. On top of the window, choose the Address Editor tab and set all the values as shown below (set the address to 0x4200_0000 and the size to 4k). Remember, the address of our GPIO block is *0x4200_0000*.

The FPGA program is ready. Proceed with *Synthesis*, *Implementation*, and *Generation of the bitstream file*. When the file is generated and copied to a folder on Red Pitaya’s Linux, write the bitstream file to programmable logic:


.. tabs::

    .. tab:: OS version 1.04 or older

        Please note that you need to change the forward slashes to backward slashes on Windows.

        1. Open Terminal or CMD and go to the .bit file location.

        .. code-block:: bash
    
            cd <Path/to/RedPitaya/repository>/prj/Examples/Stopwatch/tmp/Stopwatch/Stopwatch.runs/impl_1

        2. Send the .bit file to the Red Pitaya with the ``scp`` command or use WinSCP or a similar tool to perform the operation.

        .. code-block:: bash

            scp system_wrapper.bit root@rp-xxxxxx.local:/root/Stopwatch.bit

        3. Now establish an SSH communication with your Red Pitaya and check if you have the copy *Stopwatch.bit* in the root directory.

        .. code-block:: bash

            redpitaya> ls

        4. Load the *Stopwatch.bit* to **xdevcfg** with

        .. code-block:: bash

            redpitaya> cat Stopwatch.bit > /dev/xdevcfg

    .. tab:: OS version 2.00

        The 2.00 OS uses a new mechanism of loading the FPGA. The process will depend on whether you are using Linux or Windows as the ``echo`` command functinality differs bewteen the two.

        Please note that you need to change the forward slashes to backward slashes on Windows.

        1. On Windows, open **Vivado** and use the **TCL console**. Alternatively, use **Vivado HSL Command Prompt** (use Windows search to find it). Navigate to the *.bit* file location.

           On Linux, open the **Terminal** and go to the *.bit* file location.

           .. code-block:: bash

               cd <Path/to/RedPitaya/repository>/prj/Examples/Stopwatch/tmp/Stopwatch/Stopwatch.runs/impl_1

        2. Create *.bif* file and use it to generate a binary bitstream file (*system_wrapper.bit.bin*)

           **Windows (Vivado TCL console or Vivado HSL Command Prompt):**

           .. code-block:: bash

               echo all:{ system_wrapper.bit } >  system_wrapper.bif
               bootgen -image system_wrapper.bif -arch zynq -process_bitstream bin -o system_wrapper.bit.bin -w

           **Linux and Windows (WSL + Normal CMD):**

           .. code-block:: bash

               echo -n "all:{ system_wrapper.bit }" >  system_wrapper.bif
               bootgen -image system_wrapper.bif -arch zynq -process_bitstream bin -o system_wrapper.bit.bin -w

        3. Using a standard command prompt, send the *.bit.bin* file to the Red Pitaya with the ``scp`` command or use WinSCP or a similar tool to perform the operation.

           .. code-block:: bash
   
               scp system_wrapper.bit.bin root@rp-xxxxxx.local:/root/Stopwatch.bit.bin

        4. Now establish an SSH communication with your Red Pitaya and check if you have the copy *Stopwatch.bit.bin* in the root directory (you can use Putty or WSL).

           .. code-block:: bash

               redpitaya> ls

        5. Finally, we are ready to program the FPGA with our own bitstream file located in the **/root/** folder on Red Pitaya. 
           To program the FPGA simply execute the following line in the Red Pitaya Linux terminal that will load the *Stopwatch.bit.bin* image into the FPGA:

           .. code-block:: bash

               redpitaya> fpgautil -b Stopwatch.bit.bin


To write or read from our FPGA program we will use Red Pitaya’s |monitor tool|, available in Red Pitaya’s Linux. Try the following commands:

.. |monitor tool| raw:: html

    <a href="https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appsFeatures/command_line_tools/com_line_tool.html#monitor-utility" target="_blank">monitor tool</a>

.. code-block:: shell-session

    monitor 0x42000000 1  # write: start, SCLR = 0, CE = 1
    monitor 0x42000000 0  # write: stop,  SCLR = 0, CE = 0
    monitor 0x42000000 2  # write: clear, SCLR = 1, CE = 0
    
    monitor 0x42000000	# read: cfg  on GPIO1
    monitor 0x42000008	# read: data on GPIO2

Great, we have created a stopwatch with a resolution of 8 ns! Using the AXI communication protocol, we can easily access our GPIO IP core. More details about the GPIO core can be found in the |Vivado documentation|. If you would like to know how much time has passed between start and stop in seconds and not in the number of clock cycles, you can use the following programs to write, read, and convert data.

C Program
=========

This program, based on |Pavel Demin's code|, can also be a useful template for more advanced applications where you need to set several parameters and read large amounts of data generated on FPGA.

stopwatch.c:
------------

.. code-block:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/mman.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        int fd;
        float wait_time;
        uint32_t count;
        void *cfg;
        char *name = "/dev/mem";
        const int freq = 125000000;         // Hz

        if (argc == 2) wait_time = atof(argv[1]);
        else wait_time = 1.0;

        if((fd = open(name, O_RDWR)) < 0) {
            perror("open");
            return 1;
        }
        cfg = mmap(NULL, sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE), /* map the memory */
                    PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0x42000000);

        *((uint32_t *)(cfg + 0)) = 2;       // clear timer
        *((uint32_t *)(cfg + 0)) = 1;       // start timer

        sleep(wait_time);                   // wait for [wait_time] seconds

        *((uint32_t *)(cfg + 0)) = 0;       // stop timer

        count = *((uint32_t *)(cfg + 8));   // get binary counter output

        printf("Clock count: %5d, calculated time: %5f s\n",
                count, (double)count/freq);

        munmap(cfg, sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE));
        return 0;
    }


The stopwatch.c program maps the memory at a given address to a *cfg* pointer. By writing an appropriate 32-bit value to this pointer, the code first clears the counter by setting SCLR (2nd bit), then starts the count by setting CE (1st bit). After *wait_time* in seconds, the counter is stopped by clearing the CE bit. To read the counter’s output value, we need to access the second port of the GPIO IP core. According to the GPIO documentation:

.. figure:: img/Stopwatch3.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

The address of the second port is shifted by 8 (0x4200_0008). At the end, the counter output value is scaled by the *FCLK_CLK0* frequency and printed on the screen.

Next, copy the |stopwatch.c| program found in the *Stopwatch* folder to Red Pitaya’s Linux. Compile and execute the program as shown here:

.. |stopwatch.c| raw:: html

    <a href="https://github.com/RedPitaya/RedPitaya-FPGA/blob/master/prj/Examples/Stopwatch/stopwatch.c" target="_blank">stopwatch.c</a>


.. code-block:: shell-session

    gcc -o stopwatch stopwatch.c
    ./stopwatch 5   # wait for 5 s

==============
Python Program
==============

You can also achieve the same functionality with Python; after you have written the FPGA, connect to your Red Pitaya through the browser and navigate to the Jupyter Notebook application, which can be found in Development.

Open the Jupyter Notebook application, create a new notebook, copy the code below, save it, and finally execute it.

.. code-block:: python

    import mmap
    import os
    import time
    import numpy as np

    axi_gpio_regset = np.dtype([
        ('gpio1_data'   , 'uint32'),
        ('gpio1_control', 'uint32'),
        ('gpio2_data'   , 'uint32'),
        ('gpio2_control', 'uint32')
    ])

    ## Change the FPGA image ##

    os.system('cat /root/Stopwatch.bit > /dev/xdevcfg')    # OS 1.04 or older
    # os.system('fpgautil -b /root/Stopwatch.bit.bin')     # OS 2.00 and above

    memory_file_handle = os.open('/dev/mem', os.O_RDWR)
    axi_mmap = mmap.mmap(fileno=memory_file_handle, length=mmap.PAGESIZE, offset=0x42000000)
    axi_numpy_array = np.recarray(1, axi_gpio_regset, buf=axi_mmap)
    axi_array_contents = axi_numpy_array[0]

    freq = 125000000 #FPGA Clock Frequency Hz
    
    axi_array_contents.gpio1_data = 0x02 #clear timer
    axi_array_contents.gpio1_data = 0x01 #start timer
    time.sleep(34.2) # Count to the maximim LED (8 MSB value)
    axi_array_contents.gpio1_data = 0x00 #stop timer
    print("Clock count: ", axi_array_contents.gpio2_data, " calculated time: ", axi_array_contents.gpio2_data/freq, " Seconds")


====================================
Changing the FPGA Fabric Clock Speed
====================================

Interestingly, *FCLK_CLK0* has a frequency of 124.99875 MHz (= 3.75*33.333 MHz). This is the default Red Pitaya frequency generated by IO PLL using a 33.333 MHz external clock (PS_CLK).

The following terminal commands can be used to change the PL fabric clock speed. The script needs root access. The clock frequency can be set from 100000 to 2500000000. Clock speeds above 300000 give better timing results from a Jupyter Notebook. 125000000 is the default.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    devcfg=/sys/devices/soc0/amba/f8007000.devcfg
    test -d $devcfg/fclk/fclk0 || echo fclk0 > $devcfg/fclk_export
    echo 0 > $devcfg/fclk/fclk0/enable
    echo 2500000000 > $devcfg/fclk/fclk0/set_rate
    echo 1 > $devcfg/fclk/fclk0/enable


========================================================
Automatic generation of an example from the repository
========================================================

Move to folder **RedPitaya-FPGA/prj/Examples**. Uncomment the line *"set project_name Stopwatch"* and comment all files in the **make_project.tcl** file. Open Vivado and in Vivado Tcl Console navigate to the base folder: **RedPitaya-FPGA/prj/Examples.**

.. figure:: img/LedBlink1.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

Then run the script *source make_project.tcl*. Tools → Run Tcl Script

.. figure:: img/LedBlink2.png
    :alt: Logo
    :align: center

**make_project.tcl** automatically generates a complete project in the **RedPitaya-FPGA/prj/Examples/Stopwatch/** directory. Take a moment to examine the block design.
If the block design is not open, click on **Open Block Design** on the left-hand side of the window. When you are ready, click **Generate Bitstream** at the bottom-left part of the window to generate a bitstream file.
After you confirm that both Synthesis and Implementation will be executed beforehand the longer process starts. After successful completion of synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation, the bit file can be found at **Examples/Stopwatch/tmp/Stopwatch/Stopwatch.runs/impl_1/system_wrapper.bit**

Follow the instructions above to change the FPGA image on the Red Pitaya.
